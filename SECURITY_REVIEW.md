# Security Review for Public Repository

## ✅ SAFE TO PUBLISH

After thorough review, your repository appears safe to make public. Here's what was checked:

### ✅ Personal Data Protection
- **data/diary/** is properly excluded in .gitignore (line 104)
- Only example data in `data/examples/` is tracked
- No personal journal entries are in git

### ✅ No API Keys or Credentials
- No API keys, tokens, or secrets found in any files
- .env.memory_optimized contains only configuration settings (no secrets)
- No password or authentication strings detected

### ✅ No Personal Information
- No email addresses (except in git commit author)
- No phone numbers or addresses
- No personal names in code or documentation

### ✅ Storage Directory Excluded
- `storage/` directory (with metadata.db and vectors) is properly gitignored
- No indexed journal data will be published

### ✅ Clean Git History
- Only one reference to "personal" in initial commit message (generic term)
- No accidentally committed sensitive files in history

## Recommendations Before Going Public

1. **Consider changing git author email** (optional):
   - Current: brooke@oehmsmith.com
   - You could use GitHub's noreply email instead

2. **Double-check your local directory**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure nothing sensitive is staged
   git status

   # Verify diary data isn't tracked
   git ls-files | grep diary
   ```

3. **Add a LICENSE file** (recommended for public repos)

4. **Update README** to remove any specific personal references if present

## Files That WILL Be Public
- All source code (src/*)
- Example data (data/examples/*)
- Configuration examples (.env.memory_optimized, config_memory_optimized.json)
- Documentation (*.md files)
- Scripts (*.sh files)
- Tests

## Files That Will NOT Be Public
- Your actual journal entries (data/diary/*)
- Generated storage files (storage/*)
- Virtual environment (.venv/)
- Any .env file (only .env.memory_optimized template is included)
- Python cache files (__pycache__/)

## Final Check
Your repository is clean and safe to publish. The .gitignore file is properly configured to protect your personal journal data.
